# File Operations Reference

This skill can read files within its own directory structure and may write files only when the user explicitly asks. Use these operations to save approved agents and approved learned-pattern changes.

## Skill Directory

The skill lives at: `/mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/`

```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `view` | Read file contents | `path`, optionally line range |
| `create_file` | Create a new file | `path`, `file_text`, `description` |
| `str_replace` | Edit existing file | `path`, `old_str`, `new_str` |
| `bash_tool` | Run shell commands | `command` |

## Persistence Rule

Do not create or modify files by default.

Before saving a new agent or updating learned patterns:
1. Present the proposed change in chat
2. Ask for explicit confirmation
3. Persist only after confirmation

## How to Save a New Agent

### Step 1: Create the agent file

Use `create_file` tool:
- **path**: `/mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/[domain]-[specialty].md`
- **file_text**: The agent content following the template structure
- **description**: "Creating new [Title] agent"

Example:
```
path: /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/python-async-expert.md
file_text: [agent content here]
description: Creating new Python Async Expert agent
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the Index

Run the rebuild script to update `agents/INDEX.md`:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild-index.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify

Use `view` or `bash_tool` with `ls -la` to confirm the file was created.

## How to Update Learned Patterns

Patterns are stored at two levels. Choose the right one:

- **Global patterns** (in `SKILL.md` under `## Global Learned Patterns`): Cross-cutting insights that apply across ALL agents. Example: "Always ask about user's background first."
- **Agent-level patterns** (in the agent's own file, under `## Learned Patterns`): Domain-specific insights for ONE agent. Example: "For ML users, start with decision trees."

See `references/agent-template.md` for format templates (how to write pattern and anti-pattern entries).

### Updating Global Patterns

#### Step 1: Read SKILL.md
Use `view` to read `SKILL.md` and find the `## Global Learned Patterns` section at the end.

#### Step 2: Make the Edit
Use `str_replace` to add the new pattern under the appropriate subsection (`### Effective Patterns` or `### Anti-Patterns`).

#### Step 3: Complete Packaging Workflow
See **Packaging Workflow** below.

### Updating Agent-Level Patterns

#### Step 1: Read the Agent File
Use `view` to read the agent file in `agents/[name].md`

#### Step 2: Make the Edit
Use `str_replace` to add the pattern under `## Learned Patterns` → `### Effective Patterns` or `### Anti-Patterns` in that agent's file.

#### Step 3: Complete Packaging Workflow
See **Packaging Workflow** below.

### Packaging Workflow

Packaging is a separate maintenance task.

Use this workflow only when the user explicitly asks to package, publish, or replace the skill after approved file changes.

```bash
# Step 1: Rebuild index
cd /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse && bash scripts/rebuild-index.sh

# Step 2: Package skill
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse /home/claude/

# Step 3: Copy to outputs
cp /home/claude/professor-synapse.skill /mnt/user-data/outputs/
```

```text
# Step 4: Present to user
present_files → professor-synapse.skill
```

Only run these steps after the user explicitly requests packaging or distribution.

## Alternative: Using bash_tool

You can also use `bash_tool` for file operations:

```bash
# List available agents (the filesystem IS the index)
ls /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/

# Create a file
echo "content" > /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/python-async-expert.md

# View file contents
cat /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/domain-researcher.md
```

## Best Practices

- **Always verify** after creating/updating files using `view` or `ls`
- **Use descriptive filenames** - e.g., `python-async-expert.md`
- **Include frontmatter** - every agent needs `name`, `emoji`, `description`, `triggers` (see `agent-template.md`)
- **Rebuild index after adding agents** - run `bash scripts/rebuild-index.sh`
- **For str_replace**: The `old_str` must be unique in the file. Include surrounding context if needed
- **Read before editing** - use `view` first to see current content and find the right insertion point
- **Default to draft-first behavior** for any new agent or learned-pattern change
- **Do not modify core files such as `SKILL.md` without explicit approval**
- **Prefer writing drafts to a staging location before updating `agents/` when possible**

## Shell Compatibility Note

When writing bash commands, avoid brace expansion (e.g., `{a,b,c}`). Instead, use separate commands or list arguments explicitly. The execution environment may not support all interactive Bash features.
